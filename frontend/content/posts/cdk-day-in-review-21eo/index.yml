title: "CDK Day In Review"
excerpt: "CDK Day happened again on 30th April 2021. We had 22 speakers from across the globe give 18 talks covering AWS CDK, cdk8s, CDK for Terraform and Projen. This article will show some of the talks and go into the stats for how successful the day went. Since this is an event for the community by the community I have tried to be as transparent as possible."
