title: "Globalize Your Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels with AWS CDK"
excerpt: "At this moment, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels is a regional service. We are building real-time AWS DeepRacer analytics with Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels and Amazon Kinesis Video. We hope the solution can be used around the world. To reduce the network latency and make it high availability, we want to deploy the model to all regions with Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels support. At this moment, you cannot copy model to another region directly and you need to rebuild the model in each region. It is time-consuming and error-prone if you do it manually. On the other hand, for the place like Hong Kong, our application needs to call the model in another region, and we donâ€™t know which region is the best."
